# Kingshot Project

The **Kingshot Project** is a community-driven initiative dedicated to building tools and automation for the game [**Kingshot**](https://www.centurygames.com/games/kingshot/). Our primary focus is the [**Kingshot Discord Bot**](https://github.com/kingshot-project/bot), a free and open-source bot designed to support alliance management, event reminders, gift code redemption, and much more.

The bot is primarily maintained by [@justncodes](https://github.com/justncodes) with help from the community, and we are always looking for passionate contributors who have the motivation and the skills to contribute with their ideas and their code.
